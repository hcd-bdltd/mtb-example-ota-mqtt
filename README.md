# Over-the-air firmware update using MQTT

This code example demonstrates an over-the-air (OTA) update with PSoC&trade; 6 or XMC7000 MCU and AIROC&trade; CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&reg; combo chips. The device establishes a connection with the designated MQTT broker (this example uses AWS). It periodically checks the job document to see if a new update is available. When a new update is available, it is downloaded and written to the secondary slot (flash). On the next reboot, MCUboot handles image authentication and upgrades. The upgrade can be either overwrite-based or swap-based. In an overwrite-based upgrade, the new image from the secondary slot is simply copied to the primary slot after successful validation. There is no way to revert the upgrade if the new image is inoperable. In a swap-based upgrade, images in the primary and secondary slots are swapped. The upgrade can be reverted if the new image does not confirm its operation.

MCUboot is a "secure" bootloader for 32-bit MCUs. See the [README](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md) of the [mtb-example-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic) code example for more details.

OTA update middleware library enables the OTA feature. See the [ota-update](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update) middleware repository on Github for more details.

The ota-update middleware can function independently and work with any bootloader, as long as the required OTA update handling storage APIs are implemented and registered with OTA agent by the user. This example enables the MCUboot support with the help of ota-bootloader-abstraction middleware. See [README](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-bootloader-abstraction/blob/master/README.md) of the [ota-bootloader-abstraction](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-bootloader-abstraction) middleware for more details.

Users should build the MCUboot-based bootloader application outside of the OTA MQTT application. It is programmed separately to the device before flashing the OTA MQTT application and is not updated for the life of the device.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

1. Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

2. This code example implements a generic MQTT client that can connect to various MQTT brokers. In this document, the instructions to set up and run the MQTT client have been provided for the AWS IoT and local mosquitto MQTT brokers for reference. see section [Setting up the MQTT broker](#setting-up-the-mqtt-broker) for more details.

3. Install the Python Interpreter and add it to the top of the system path in environmental variables. This code example is tested with [Python v3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).

> **Note:** This code example currently does not work with the custom BSP name for the KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2 and CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W kits. If you want to change the BSP name to a non-default value, ensure to update the custom BSP name in *Makefile* under the relevant section. The build fails, if you do not update the custom BSP name.

## Structure and overview

This code example is a dual-core application, where the MCUboot-based bootloader application runs on the CM0P core and the OTA MQTT application runs on the CM4/CM7 core. The OTA MQTT application fetches the new image and places it in the secondary slot (flash), then the MCUboot takes care of updating the existing image with the new image. The [mtb-example-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic) code example is the MCUboot-based bootloader application used for this purpose.

The MCUboot-based bootloader application and this OTA MQTT application should be built and programmed independently. They must be placed separately in the workspace as you would do for any other two independent applications. For this example, only the MCUboot-based bootloader application is required. The root directory of the MCUboot-based bootloader application is referred to as *\<MCUboot>/<bootloader_app>* and the root directory of the OTA MQTT application is referred to as *\<OTA_MQTT>* in this document. An example workspace is as follows:

   ```
   <example-workspace>
      |
      |-<MCUboot>               # MCUboot-based bootloader and blinky applications directory
      |-<OTA_MQTT>              # OTA MQTT application directory
      |-<mtb_shared>            # Shared library for both the applications
      |
   ```
You must first build and program the MCUboot-based bootloader application into the CM0P core, and this should be done only once. The OTA MQTT application can then be programmed into the CM4/CM7 core, and you need to only modify this application for all application purposes.

This README expects you to be familiar with MCUboot and its concepts. See [MCUboot basics](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#mcuboot-basics) and MCUboot repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/tree/v1.9.1-cypress/boot/cypress) for more information.

## Testing flow of OTA MQTT application
   Follow the flow chart as shown in **Figure 1**.

   **Figure 1. Testing flow of OTA MQTT application**

   ![](images/testing_flow_of_ota_mqtt_application.png)


## Building and programming MCUboot

The [mtb-example-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic) code example bundles two applications: MCUboot-based bootloader application that runs on CM0P core, and blinky application that runs on CM4/CM7 core.

1. Import the [mtb-example-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic) code example per the instructions in the [Using the code example](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#using-the-code-example) section of its readme.

2. The MCUboot-based bootloader and OTA MQTT applications must have the same understanding of the memory layout. The memory layout is defined through JSON files. The OTA MQTT application provides a set of predefined JSON files that can be readily used. Both the MCUboot-based bootloader and OTA MQTT applications must use the same JSON file.

   The *\<OTA_MQTT>/flashmap* folder contains the pre-defined flashmap JSON files. The following files are supported by this example.

   **Table 1. Supported JSON files**

   Target      | Supported JSON files
   ----------- |----------------------------------
   CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 <br> CY8CPROTO-062-4343W <br> CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373EM2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-CYW43022CUB | psoc62_2m_ext_overwrite_single.json <br> psoc62_2m_ext_swap_single.json
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | psoc62_512k_xip_swap_single.json
   KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2 | xmc7200_int_overwrite_single.json <br> xmc7200_int_swap_single.json

   <br>

   Copy the required flashmap JSON file from the *\<OTA_MQTT>/flashmap* folder and paste it in the *\<MCUboot>/flashmap* folder.

3. Modify the value of the `FLASH_MAP` variable in the *\<MCUboot>/user_config.mk* file to the selected JSON file name from the previous step.

4. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

5. Open a CLI terminal.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open 'modus-shell' app from the Start menu.

6. Navigate the terminal to the *\<mtb_shared>/mcuboot/\<tag>/scripts* folder.

7. Run the following commands to ensure that the required modules are installed.

    > **Note:** For Linux and macOS platforms, please use python3 instead of python in the below command.

      ```
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      ```
      python -m pip install --upgrade cysecuretools==5.0.0
      ```

   > **Note:** cysecuretools is used for signing the image for XMC7000 MCUs.

8. Open a serial terminal emulator and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to **8N1** and **115200** baud.

9. Build and program the bootloader application per the [Step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#step-by-step-instructions) in its README or simply follow the instruction as shown below.

   <details open><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, go to *\<MCUboot>/bootloader_app* and execute the `make program_proj` command to build and program the MCUboot-based bootloader application using the default toolchain to the seleted target.

      ```
      make program_proj
      ```
   </details>

    After programming, the MCUboot starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays a message as shown in **Figure 2**:

    **Figure 2. Booting with no bootable image**

    ![](images/booting_without_bootable_image.png)


## Setting up the MQTT broker

<details><summary><b>AWS IoT Core</b></summary>

 1. Set up the MQTT device (also known as a *Thing*) in the AWS IoT core as described in the [Getting started with AWS IoT tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html).

   > **Note:** While setting up your device, ensure that the policy associated with this device permits all MQTT operations (*iot:Connect*, *iot:Publish*, *iot:Receive*, and *iot:Subscribe*) for the resource used by this device. For testing purposes, it is recommended to have the following policy document which allows all *MQTT Policy Actions* on all *Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)*.
      
   ```
   {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "iot:*",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
   }
   ```
    
 2. Download the following certificates and keys that are created and activated in the previous step:
       - A certificate for the AWS IoT Thing - *xxxxxxxxxx.aws-client-certificate.crt*
       - A private key - *xxxxxxxxxx.aws-private.key* or *xxxxxxxxxx.aws-private.pem*
       - Root CA "RSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1" for AWS IoT from [CA certificates for server authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/server-authentication.html#server-authentication-certs) - *xxxx.AmazonRootCA1.crt*.

 3. Copy the certificates and key, paste it in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder.

 4. Rename the following file names in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder.
      - *xxxx.AmazonRootCA1.crt*      to        *aws_ca.crt*
      - *xxxxxxxxxx.aws-client-certificate.crt*    to     *aws_client.crt*
      - *xxxxxxxxxx.aws-private.key*    to      *aws_private.key*

</details>

<details><summary><b>Mosquitto local broker</b></summary>

This code example uses the locally installable mosquitto that runs on your computer as the default broker. You can also use one of the other public MQTT brokers listed at [https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers).

1. Download the executable setup from [Mosquitto downloads](https://mosquitto.org/download/) site.

2. Run the setup to install the software. During installation, uncheck the **Service** component. Also, note down the installation directory.

3. Once the installation is complete, add the installation directory to the system **Path**.

4. Open a CLI terminal.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the 'modus-shell' app from the Start menu.

5. Navigate to the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder.

6. Execute the following command to generate self-signed SSL certificates and keys. On Linux and macOS, you can get your device local IP address by running the `ifconfig` command on any terminal application. On Windows, run the `ipconfig` command on a command prompt.

   ```
   sh generate_ssl_cert.sh <local-ip-address-of-your-pc>
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   sh generate_ssl_cert.sh 192.168.0.10
   ```

   This step will generate the following files in the same *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* directory:

   1. *mosquitto_ca.crt* - Root CA certificate
   2. *mosquitto_ca.key* - Root CA private key
   3. *mosquitto_server.crt* - Server certificate
   4. *mosquitto_server.key* - Server private key
   5. *mosquitto_client.crt* - Client certificate
   6. *mosquitto_client.key* - Client private key

7. The *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/mosquitto.conf* file is preconfigured for starting the Mosquitto server for this code example. You can edit the file if you wish to make other changes to the broker settings.

8. Starting the MQTT server:

   - **Using the code example in TLS mode (default):**

      1. Execute the following command:

         ```
         mosquitto -v -c mosquitto.conf
         ```

   - **Using the code example in Non-TLS mode:**

      1. Edit the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/mosquitto.conf* file.
         1. change the value of `require_certificate` parameter to `false`.
         2. change the value of `listener` parameter to `1883`.

      2. Execute the following command:

         ```
         mosquitto -v -c mosquitto.conf
         ```
</details>

## Setting up the MQTT publisher script

1. Open a CLI terminal.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open 'modus-shell' app from the Start menu.

2. Navigate to the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder.

3. Run the following command to ensure that the required Python modules are installed.

      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. Edit the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/publisher.py* file to configure your MQTT publisher (MQTT server).

   1. Modify the value of the `BOARD` variable to your selected `TARGET` in the following format.
   
      ```
      if TARGET=APP_CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439, then BOARD = "APP_CY8CPROTO_062S2_43439"

      if TARGET=APP_KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2, then BOARD = "APP_KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2"
      ```
      For example:
      ```
      BOARD = "APP_CY8CPROTO_062S2_43439"
      ```
      > **Note:** Please make sure to change the `-` to `_` in the `BOARD` variable value after copied from the `TARGET` variable.

   2. Modify the value of the `AMAZON_BROKER_ADDRESS` variable to your custom endpoint on the **Settings** page of the AWS IoT console. This has the format `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.<region>.amazonaws.com`.
      > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then modify the value of `MOSQUITTO_BROKER_LOCAL_ADDRESS` to the local IP address of your MQTT broker.

   3. Ensure the value of the `BROKER_ADDRESS` variable is `AMAZON_BROKER_ADDRESS`.
      > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then modify the value of `BROKER_ADDRESS` to `MOSQUITTO_BROKER_LOCAL_ADDRESS`.

   4. Ensure the value of the `TLS_ENABLED` variable is `True`.

   5. Ensure the value of the `BROKER_PORT` variable is `8883`.
       > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then ensure the value of `BROKER_PORT` variable is `8884`. Currently in the *publisher.py* file conditional if-else block is used to automatically select a `BROKER_PORT` value based on the selected MQTT broker.

5. Ensure the certificate and key file names in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder and following variables value in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/publisher.py* file are same.
      - `ca_certs` = "aws_ca.crt"
      - `certfile` = "aws_client.crt"
      - `keyfile`  = "aws_private.key"

      The above variables are present under AMAZON BROKER section at the last in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/publisher.py* file.
      > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then ensure the certificate and key file names in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder and above variables value in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/publisher.py* file under `MOSQUITTO_BROKER_LOCAL_ADDRESS` section are same. Currently in the *publisher.py* file conditional if-else block is used to automatically select a default certificate and key file names based on the selected MQTT broker.

6. Run the *publisher.py* Python script.

    The scripts take arguments such as kit name, broker URL, and file path. For details on the supported arguments and their usage, execute the following command:

     > **Note:** For Linux and macOS platforms, please use python3 instead of python in the below command.

     ```
     python publisher.py --help
     ```

     To start the publisher script for the default settings of this example, execute the following command:

     ```
     python publisher.py tls
     ```

     After starting the publisher, the publisher will connect to the broker and subscribe to the topic as shown in **Figure 3**.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to **8N1** and **115200** baud.

3. Modify the `PLATFORM` variable in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/Makefile* based on the target you have selected. Currently in the Makefile a conditional if-else block is used to automatically select a value based on the target selected. You can remove it and directly assign a value as per **Table 2**.

   **Table 2: Target-specific platform values**

   Target      | `PLATFORM` value
   ----------- |----------------------------------
   CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 <br> CY8CPROTO-062-4343W <br> CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373EM2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-CYW43022CUB | PSOC_062_2M
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | PSOC_062_512K
   KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2 | XMC7200

   <br>

4. Modify the `OTA_FLASH_MAP` variable in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/Makefile* to change the JSON file name to match the selection made while programming the MCUboot-based bootloader application. Currently in the Makefile, a conditional if-else block is used to automatically select a default flash map file based on the target selected. You can remove it and directly assign the required flash map file to the `OTA_FLASH_MAP` variable.

   The *\<OTA_MQTT>/flashmap* folder contains the pre-defined flashmap JSON files. The following files are supported by this example.

   **Table 3: Supported JSON files**

   Target      | Supported JSON files
   ----------- |----------------------------------
   CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 <br> CY8CPROTO-062-4343W <br> CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373EM2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-CYW43022CUB | psoc62_2m_ext_overwrite_single.json <br> psoc62_2m_ext_swap_single.json
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | psoc62_512k_xip_swap_single.json
   KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2 | xmc7200_int_overwrite_single.json <br> xmc7200_int_swap_single.json

   <br>

      > **Note:** Both the MCUboot-based bootloader and OTA MQTT applications must use the same JSON file.

5. Edit the *\<OTA_MQTT>/configs/ota_app_config.h* file to configure your OTA MQTT application:

   1. Modify the connection configuration such as `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY` macros to match the settings of your Wi-Fi network.

        > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then make sure that the device running the MQTT local broker and the kit are connected to the same network.

   2. Modify the value of the `MQTT_BROKER_URL` macro to your custom endpoint on the **Settings** page of the AWS IoT console. This has the format `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

       > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then modify the value of `MQTT_BROKER_URL` to the local IP address of your MQTT broker.

   3. Ensure the value of the `MQTT_SERVER_PORT` macro is `8883`.

      > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then modify the value of `MQTT_SERVER_PORT` to `8884`. if the code example has been configured to work in non-TLS mode: Set the value of `MQTT_SERVER_PORT` to `1883`.
   4. By default, this code example works in TLS mode. To use the example in non-TLS mode, modify `ENABLE_TLS` to `false` and skip the next step of adding the certificate.

   5. Add the certificates and key:

      1. Open a CLI terminal.

          On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open 'modus-shell' app from the Start menu.

      2. Navigate the terminal to *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* directory.

      3. Run the *format_cert_key.py* Python script to generate the string format of the certificate and key files that can be added as a macro. Pass the name of the certificate or key with the extension as an argument to the Python script:

         > **Note:** For Linux and macOS platforms, please use python3 instead of python in the below command.

         ```
         python format_cert_key.py <one-or-more-file-name-of-certificate-or-key-with-extension>
         ```
         
         For example:
         ```
         python format_cert_key.py aws_ca.crt aws_client.crt aws_private.key
         ```

         You can either convert the values to strings by running the *format_cert_key.py* scripts like shown above or you can use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/Infineon/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

      4. Copy the generated strings and add it to the `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`, `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` and `CLIENT_KEY` macros per the sample shown.

6. Edit the job document (*\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/ota_update.json*):

   1. Modify the value of `Broker` to match the value of the `MQTT_BROKER_URL` variable, `MQTT_BROKER_URL` variable present in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/configs/ota_app_config.h* file.

   2. Modify the value of the variable `Board` to your selected `TARGET` in the following format.
     
      ```
      if TARGET=APP_CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439, then Board:"APP_CY8CPROTO_062S2_43439"

      if TARGET=APP_KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2, then Board:"APP_KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2"
      ```
      For example:
      ```
        "Board":"APP_CY8CPROTO_062S2_43439",
      ```
      > **Note:** Please make sure to change the `-` to `_` in the `Board` variable value while coping from the `TARGET` variable.

   3. Ensure the value of the `Port` macro is `8883`.
      > **Note:** If you are using the local MQTT broker (e.g Mosquitto broker), then modify the value of `Port` to `8884`. if the code example has been configured to work in non-TLS mode: Set the value of `Port` to `1883`.

7. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      For example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   After programming, MCUboot will validate the primary image. After successfully validating the primary image, MCUboot let the CM4/CM7 core run the image from the primary slot. Observe that the user LED blinks at a one second interval. Observe the messages on the UART terminal and wait for the device to make the required connections. Once the MQTT client (device) is connected to the broker, it will download the job document (*ota_update.json*) as shown in **Figure 5**. 

    **Figure 4** shows the logs of publisher while publishing the job document.

    **Figure 4. Publishing the job document**

    ![](images/publishing_the_job_doc.png)

   **Figure 5. Connection to the MQTT broker and downloaded the job document**

   ![](images/connection_mqtt_broker.png)

8. The job document (*ota_update.json*) placed in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts* folder has value of `Version` as **1.0.0**. The OTA update will not happen, because the OTA MQTT application version and available update version are the same.

9. Modify the value of the `BLINKY_DELAY_MS` macro to **(100)** in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/source/led_task.c* file and change the application version in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/Makefile* by setting `APP_VERSION_MINOR` to **1**.

10. Build the application (**DO NOT** program it to the kit). This new image will be published to the MQTT broker in the following steps to demonstrate the OTA update.

    <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **Build \<Application Name> Application**.
    </details>

    <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      1. From the terminal, execute the `make build` command to build the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a toolchain manually:
         ```
         make build TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
         ```
         For example:
         ```
         make build TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
         ```
    </details>

11. After a successful build, edit the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/ota_update.json* file to modify the value of `Version` to **1.1.0**.

12. The OTA MQTT application now finds and downloads the updated job document, and now the available update version is higher than the OTA MQTT application version. So, the OTA MQTT application starts to download the new image as shown in **Figure 7** and places it in the secondary slot. Once the download is completed, a soft reset is issued. Then the MCUboot starts the image upgrade process (swapping the images between the primary and secondary slots, after successfully validating the secondary image).

    **Figure 6** shows the logs of publisher while publishing the new image.

    **Figure 6. Publishing the new image**

    ![](images/publishing_the_new_image.png)

    **Figure 7. Image download**

    ![](images/downloading_new_image.png)

13. After the image upgrade is successfully completed, MCUboot lets the CM4/CM7 core run the new image from the primary slot. Observe that the user LED is now blinking at a 100-millisecond interval and The UART terminal displays the message as shown in **Figure 8**.

    **Figure 8. Updated to new image**

    ![](images/updated_to_new_image.png)
  
14. To test the revert feature of MCUboot, send a bad image as **v1.2.0** OTA update. The bad image used in this example is an infinite loop. The watchdog timer will reset the bad image and upon reboot, MCUboot will revert the primary image back to **v1.1.0** good image. Edit *\<OTA_MQTT>/Makefile* and add `TEST_REVERT` to the `Defines` variable as shown:

      ```
      DEFINES+=TEST_REVERT
      ```

      
    > **Note:** In an overwrite-based upgrade, the secondary image is simply copied to the primary slot after successful validation. There is no way to revert the upgrade if the secondary image is inoperable. `TEST_REVERT` feature is not applicable for overwrite-based upgrade.

    See the [MCUboot basics](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#mcuboot-basics) of the [mtb-example-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic) code example for more details about the overwrite-based and swap-based upgrades.

15. Edit the application version in the *\<OTA_MQTT>/Makefile* by setting `APP_VERSION_MINOR` to **2**.

16. Build the application per **Step 10**.

17. After a successful build, edit the *\<OTA_MQTT>/scripts/ota_update.json* file to modify the value of `Version` to **1.2.0**.

18. The OTA MQTT application will now find this new **v1.2.0** image and update to it. After the update, within a few seconds, the watchdog timer resets the devices. Upon reset, MCUboot reverts to the **v1.1.0** good image. The UART terminal displays the message as shown in **Figure 9**.

    **Figure 9. Reverting to good image**

    ![](images/reverting_to_good_image.png)

> **Note:** After completing the last step, the device will be running the **v1.1.0** good image and the publisher will still be hosting the **v1.2.0** bad image. Because the version of the image hosted by the publisher is greater than the version of the image on the device, the device will re-download the **v1.2.0** bad image. This causes an infinite upgrade and reverts the cycle. To avoid this scenario, stop the publisher script after you test the code example. In a production environment, the application is responsible for blacklisting bad image versions and to avoid upgrading to them in the future.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some codes executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

**Figure 10** shows the flow of the OTA update process using MQTT. The application which needs OTA updates should run the OTA agent. The OTA agent spawns threads to receive OTA updates when available, without intervening with the application's core functionality.

The initial application resides in the primary slot of the flash. When the OTA agent receives an update, the new image is placed in the secondary slot of the flash. On the next reboot, MCUboot copies the image from the secondary slot into the primary slot and then CM4 or CM7 will run the upgraded image from the primary slot.

**Figure 10. Overview of OTA update using MQTT**

![](images/ota_mqtt_update_flow.png)

For more details on the features and configurations offered by the [ota-update](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update) library, see its [README](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update/blob/master/README.md).

Both MCUboot-based bootloader and user applications must have an identical understanding of the memory layout, otherwise, the MCUboot may consider an authentic image as invalid.

For more details on the features and configurations of MCUboot-based bootloader, see the [Design and implementation of MCUboot](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#design-and-implementation).

This example implements two RTOS tasks: OTA client and LED blinky. Both these tasks are independent and do not communicate with each other. The OTA client task initializes the dependent middleware and starts the OTA agent. The LED task blinks the user LED at a specified delay.

All the source files related to the two tasks are placed under the *\<OTA_MQTT>/source* folder:

**Table 4: Source files related to OTA client and LED blinky**
 File | Description
:-----|:------
*ota_task.c*| Contains the task and functions related to the OTA client.
*ota_task.h* | Contains the public interfaces for the OTA client task.
*led_task.c* | Contains the task and functions related to LED blinking.

### Security

The MCUboot-based bootloader application enables image authentication feature of MCUboot library. MCUboot verifies the signature of the image in the primary slot every time before booting. In addition, it verifies the signature of the image in the secondary slot before copying it to the primary slot. When these options are enabled, the public key (cypress-test-ec-p256.pub) is embedded within the MCUboot-based bootloader application. The OTA MQTT application is signed using the private key (cypress-test-ec-p256.pem) during the post-build steps, the ota-bootloader-abstraction library is taken care the image signing for the OTA MQTT application.

the MCUboot-based bootloader application includes a sample public key (cypress-test-ec-p256.pub) under the *\<MCUboot>/keys* directory and the OTA MQTT application includes a sample private key (cypress-test-ec-p256.pem) under the *\<mtb_shared>/ota-bootloader-abstraction/\<tag>/scripts/mcuboot/keys* directory. Both the *\<MCUboot>/keys* and *\<mtb_shared>/ota-bootloader-abstraction/\<tag>/scripts/mcuboot/keys* directories **must have the same pair of keys**. Otherwise image (primary/secondary) validation fails, MCUboot-based bootloader application will prints a message "MCUBoot Bootloader found none of bootable images".

**You must not use this key pair in your end product.** See [Generating a key pair](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#generating-a-key-pair) for generating a new key pair. Once you generated the key pair, copy the keys to the both *\<MCUboot>/keys* and *\<mtb_shared>/ota-bootloader-abstraction/\<tag>/scripts/mcuboot/keys* directories.

> **Note:** See [Security](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md#security) to learn more about the image authentication feature of MCUboot.
